# Data Analyst | Sociologist
--------

After graduating in Sociology and completing my knowledge with a Master's degree in Sociology Applied to Social Problems, I decided to bet on the immediate future as Big Data. I have done the Data Analytics bootcamp at `Ironhack`, which is an intensive way to complement my knowledge from the programming, allowing you to be totally free, creative and autonomous.

These are some of my projects in Ironhack:
