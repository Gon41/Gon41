# Data Analyst | Sociologist

----

## About me:

After graduating in Sociology and completing my knowledge with a Master's degree in Sociology Applied to Social Problems, I decided to bet on the immediate future as Big Data. I have done the Data Analytics bootcamp at `Ironhack`, which is an intensive way to complement my knowledge from the programming, allowing you to be totally free, creative and autonomous.
